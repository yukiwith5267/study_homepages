As I wanted to record nature sounds like rain sounds, I bought a portable recorder called [Zoom H1n](https://amzn.to/3eF2NP9). Since I'm really happy with the sound quality, it is used for recording the keyboard sounds as well now. It is pretty great for making ASMR videos.

It supports audio I/F mode, so you can use it as a USB microphone. I hope the next generation comes with a USB-C port.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(void){
    
}
```
