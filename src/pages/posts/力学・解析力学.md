I’ve been sitting on a chair from Herman Miller called [Aeron Chair](https://amzn.to/3mzPwFZ) for more than 5 years now. You may know this chair because it’s so popular around the world. I bought it at Rakuten Ichiba. I was using a very cheap chair before buying it. I found myself not so tired since I switched to this chair. It’s so durable and hasn’t broken at all even after 5 years of use. So, I think it’s worth the price. Take care of your back.
